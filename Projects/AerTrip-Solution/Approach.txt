I have trained a simple Logistic Regression model based on Bag of words approach.

Tried using dependecy parser to get to amd from destination.

Was not able to capture the dates onward and return.


For checking the solution you need to install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt

and the run python app.py

I have also included the Database collection named "info_data.json"

Sample Input:-
{
    "text":"I want to return on 7th Feb from Delhi"
}

Sample Output:-

{
    "response_data": {
        "Departure_Time": [],
        "Events": [],
        "Journey_Type": "Return",
        "Onward_Time": [
            "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT"
        ],
        "WeekDays": [],
        "from": "Delhi",
        "text": "I want to return on 7th Feb from Delhi",
        "to": "Where do you want to go ?"
    },
    "success": true
}
